# How I built my personal website.
### 1 minute read
Hello world, and welcome to my first ever blog post! In this blog I'll be talking about the creation of my personal website. I've always loved the idea of having my own website. In fact, I even created one 5 years ago using blogger. However, this is my first ever time making a proper portfolio website using JavaScript. So this is how I've done it!

## Stack
The tools you use to create something is incredibly important. So, here's are the tools I used:

• Next.js <br/>
• SCSS & PostCSS<br/>
• Prisma<br/>
• PlanetScale<br/> 
• MDX<br/>
• Vercel

## Design
I've always loved minimalism, and 've always loved creating websites. So for this reason, I decided to create a minimalist personal website. I really love a simple black and white colour scheme, so I decided to use it for this website.

## Inspiration
It's extremely important to have inspiration. Everything starts because of inspiration or a random notion. And in my case it was inspiration. So, let's take a look at some of my main inspirations for creating this website: 

<div classNames={styles.inspoLinks}>
• <a href="https://brianlovin.com"> brianlovin.com</a><br/>
• <a href="https://emilkowal.ski"> emilkowal.ski</a><br/>
• <a href="https://mattglei.ch">mattglei.ch</a><br/>
• <a href="https://leerob.io">leerob.io</a>
</div>

## Conclusion
This is the end of my first ever blog. Thank you so much for taking the time to read it, and keep an eye out for the next blog!
